              Conclusion: The Intersection of Science and the Concept of Race

             Through this website, I explored how cultural beliefs and values shaped early scientific ideas about race. My main focus was on how European colonial expansion and social hierarchies influenced the development of “scientific” frameworks that classified people into racial categories. I examined the work of historical figures like François Bernier, Immanuel Kant, and Carl Linnaeus, who played significant roles in formalizing racial categories. Their contributions were not neutral; they reflected the cultural and political need to justify colonialism and the subjugation of non-European people.

            I wanted to understand how culture shaped these scientific ideas about race, and whether early racial categories were based on genuine science or were driven by the biases and agendas of the time. My research revealed that racial classifications were less about inherent human differences and more about upholding European superiority. The racial hierarchies constructed by these early scientists and philosophers provided a “scientific” rationale for the inequalities imposed on other groups.</p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            In reflecting on what I found, I recognize that early racial science was deeply intertwined with cultural beliefs and power structures. This project has shown me how essential it is to question the cultural influences on science and to remain critical of how “objective” truths can sometimes perpetuate harmful ideologies.</p>
