              Colonialism and Its Connection to Eugenics
              </h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              The ideas of race and eugenics emerged from a desire to rationalize conquest, subjugation, and slavery, fueling a scientific framework that validated the social hierarchy and exploitation inherent to colonialism. Oliver Cromwell Cox’s work emphasizes that the concept of race, as we know it, grew directly from European colonialism, where Europeans, driven by economic and territorial ambitions, saw fit to classify non-Europeans as inherently inferior. This stratification was essential: if those being conquered or enslaved were less than fully human, their subjugation could be justified within a moral and even religious framework. Early scientific efforts, later formalized in the eugenics movement, sought to “prove” these racial hierarchies through pseudoscientific classifications that labeled non-Europeans as biologically and morally distinct, often deficient. George Fredrickson highlights that this constructed notion of race allowed Europeans to resolve the ideological tension posed by Enlightenment values of equality. By redefining non-Europeans as inherently lacking the qualities of full humanity, colonial powers could justify their exploitation under the guise of an immutable natural order. Consequently, eugenics and early racial science became tools to sustain colonial dominance and uphold a worldview that placed Europeans at the pinnacle of a scientifically justified social and moral hierarchy, revealing the powerful influence of cultural and economic agendas on scientific thinking.

              European Culture and Eugenics
              </h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">The formalization of race in the 17th and 18th centuries marked an important turning point-that is, associating social hierarchies with perceived biological differences, and thereby giving racial ideologies scientific legitimacy. François Bernier's 1684 work founded earlier scholarship that delineated humans into distinct "species" based on the superficial traits of the individuals he encountered while traveling, creating nascent theories of what would become racial science. While his idea of "race" hinged more on the meaning of "variety" than what the modern world defines it as, it nonetheless started a trend in defining human beings through differences in observable physical features that naturalized these divisions. It is during the Enlightenment that race is finally cemented into scientific and philosophical thought, most notably with thinkers like Immanuel Kant and Carl Linnaeus. Kant elaborated a hierarchical racial schemata, arguing that all humans derived from a common European stock, with Whites at the top and Blacks at the bottom. He ascribed to Black Africans inherent intellectual inferiority. Linnaeus then fixed these racial hierarchies by ascribing behavioral characteristics to the various racial groups in Systema Naturae, ascribing positive attributes to Europeans and negative ones to other races. It is that sort of categorization that reiterated the European worldview and conferred social worth based on biological characteristics, placing Whites in an ontologically superior position.
              Through such authoritative categorizations, Kant, Linnaeus, and other Enlightenment thinkers rendered race as a "natural" order, stretching the concept of the Great Chain of Being into human populations, with Europeans at the pinnacle. These ideas bestowed an intellectual and scientific background on colonialism, slavery, and other forms of subjugation of non-European people by virtually suggesting that these were instances endorsed by nature itself. Through race, an actual foundational ideology was substantiated for economic and social stratification in the colonial societies-particularly in the Americas-where the racial hierarchies dove-tailed with class structures to create resilient systems of inequality. By this route, the cultural beliefs of European superiority actually developed into scientific practices and philosophies of the time, embedding racial classification within the fabric of Western thought and the policy and social norms it dictated for generations.</p>
